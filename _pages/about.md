I am currently a second-year Master's student at Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (SIGS), majoring in Electronic Information (Artificial Intelligence) under the supervision of Professor Haoqian Wang. In Fall 2023, I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Aircraft Control and Information Engineering from Beihang University (Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics).

**Current Research Focus:**  

My work primarily centers on:  

- **Controllable Multimodal Generation** (e.g., text-to-image/video synthesis with fine-grained control)
- **Low-Level Vision**
- 
  ▪ Image Restoration (denoising, super-resolution)  
  ▪ Computational Imaging (novel reconstruction paradigms)  
- **Self-Supervised & Unsupervised Learning**  
  ▪ Representation learning from unlabeled visual data  
  ▪ Cross-modal pretraining strategies
